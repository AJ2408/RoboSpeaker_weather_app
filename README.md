# RoboSpeaker_weather_app

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robot speaker-based weather app that provides users with a convenient and hands-free way to access weather information. The app will be able to understand natural language queries and generate responses in a clear and concise manner. This allows users to access weather information without having to look at a screen or type anything.

#### Project goal:

The main goals of this project are to:

1) Develop a robot speaker-based weather app that is easy to use and provides users with accurate and timely weather information.

2) Make the app accessible to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities.

3) Implement natural language processing capabilities to allow users to interact with the app in a natural and intuitive way.

4) Personalize the weather experience for each user by taking into account their location and preferences.


## Important Liabraries 
**1) Pyttsx3 :-**

The pyttsx3 module is a Python library that provides text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. It is a cross-platform library that supports 
various TTS engines.Pyttsx3 can be used to create applications that can speak text, such as virtual assistants, educational software, and games. It can also be used to convert text to speech for accessibility purposes.
Pyttsx3 supports various TTS engines, including SAPI5 on Windows, NSSpeechSynthesizer on macOS, and eSpeak on Linux.

**2) SAPI5 :-**

SAPI is an speech API developed by Microsoft to allow the use of speech recognition and speech synthesis within Windows applications.
In Python, SAPI5 can be used with the pyttsx3 module to create applications that can speak text.

**3) speechRecognition module :-**

The SpeechRecognition module in Python is a library that provides speech recognition capabilities. It supports a variety of speech recognition engines, including Google Speech Recognition, Microsoft Speech Recognition, and IBM Watson Speech to Text.
